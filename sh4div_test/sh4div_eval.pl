# This script serves as a simple evaluation test for sh4div_test.
#
# It attaches to an already-running WashingtonDC session (launched with the
# -t and -c flags) via the cmd prompt and the serial server.  It begin's
# execution and logs the output.  That output is then compared to a capture of
# sh4div_test which was previously taken from a real Dreamcast over dc-tool
# (ideally it would have been taken over serial but I haven't gotten around to
# building my coder's cable yet).  Certain lines are ignored if they match
# certain regexp patterns (see the do_ignore subroutine), but other than that
# the output from WashingtonDC should perfectly match the capture from the
# Dreamcast since they're both running the same program.
#
# this script requires the Net::Telnet perl package to function.
